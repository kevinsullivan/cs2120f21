So far in this class, we've worked with just
a few types of data, mostly natural numbers,
though we've also seen that we have a Boolean
type (with values ff and tt) and a string type,
with values such as "" and "Hello, Logic!"

Today we're going to break some new ground with
the introduction of inductively defined types
and their corresponding induction axioms. These
new axioms, one per data type, will give us a
new way to construct proofs of properties *for
all* values of a given type, or to construct 
output results for functions that can take 
*any* value of a given type as an argument.
-/

/-
We will see not only that we can *define new
data types* of our own, but also that (1) we
can define the introduction rules for each
new type, in the form of a set of constructors,
which you use to *construct* value of a type; 
and (2) each such type comes with an axiom that
defined an elimination rule for that type that
we call an *induction* axiom or principle. 

This axiom enables you either (1) to construct 
a *logical proof* that, every value of the type
makes some proposition true (e.g., that every
value of a type has a given property); or (2)
to define a computational *function* that, for 
any argument value of the given type returns a 
correct value.
-/

/-
When we construct a proof using an induction 
principle we call it "proof by induction." When
we define a function using an induction principle
we (generally) call it a "recursive" function.
-/

/-
To help build an understanding of these ideas
based on what you already know, we'll look at
the induction principles, and how to use them
both to construct proofs and to define functions,
for the following five types:

empty   -- an uninhabited *data* type
unit    -- a data type with one value ("star")  (i.e. void return type in Java)
bool    -- a data type with two values (tt, ff) 
nat     -- a data type with an infinity of values
list α  -- a "polymorphic" type of lists of α values

EMPTY TYPE

inductive empty : Type

-- Introduction rules

/-
That we defie no constructors for this type
means that is has no introduction rules means
that there are no values of this data type.
It is empty, or uninhabited.
-/

-- Elimination rules

/-
Given any inductively defined data type, we
are given a new elimination axiom, called a
"recursor." In Lean, if the name of a type
is "empty" (for example), its recursor is 
called "empty.rec". Let's see and analyze
what the recursor for the empty type looks
like. Remember: In a nutshell, it's a rule
for (1) constructing a proof of a universal 
generalization, that all values of a given
type have some property, or (2) defining a
function that returns a value for *every*
value of its argument type. 
-/

Read Π as meaning the same thing as ∀, and 
(Sort u_1) as meaning either Prop (Sort 0),
in which case we're talking about obtaining
proofs, or Type (Sort 1), in which case we're
talking about obtaining values of functions
that return data values as results.

Let's consider two variants. First, suppose
u_1 is 0. Sort 0 is the same as Prop, so we're
talking about proving that, given any property 
of values of this type (Lean calls it "motive"),
that any value, n, of this type has this property.

For any property of unit values (u_1 = 0) 
or any function from unit to another type
(u_1 = 1), if we have a proof or value for 
unit.star, then we have a proof or value 
for every value, n, of this type.

In all of the examples we've seen so far,
proof by recursion looks an awful lot like
proof by case analysis. Indeed, we could 
have used cases in all of these examples.
But we'll see in our next examples that in
general there's a fundamental difference:
a proof by induction generally gives you
one or more "induction hypotheses" to work
with, and that can be crucial.

example : 
    ∀ (b : bool), bor b bool.ff = b :=

  assume b,

NAT

inductive nat : Type
-- two cases
  | zero              -- base: no arguments       
  | succ (n' : nat)   -- inductive case
/-
Notice that the second constructor givesn 
us a way to construct the next larger natural
number, succ n', from a given smaller natural
number, n'. Now we have a genuinely inductive
definition.
-/


/-
And now we will see where induction differs
from mere case analysis.
-/
#check @nat.rec
#check @nat.rec_on

/-
nat.rec :
  Π {motive : nat → Sort u_1},
    motive nat.zero → 
    (Π (n' : nat), motive n' → motive n'.succ) → 
    Π (n : nat), motive n

Given any propery or function on natural numbers
(motive), if you're given a proof/answer for zero,
and if for any natural number if you have a way to
derive proof/answer for n'+1 from a proof/answer 
for n', then you can construct a proof/answer for
any natural number, n.

nat.rec_on :
Π {motive : nat → Sort u_1},                      (1)
    motive nat.zero →                             (2)
    (Π (n' : nat), motive n' → motive n'.succ) →  (3)
    Π (n : nat), motive n                         (4)

Sort u_1 could be Prop (Sort 0), or Type (Sort 1), or other.

Given that here's how we can read this axiom.

(1) given any property of natural numbers, or any
function from natural numbers to values of another
type, ...
(2) if the property holds, or we have an answer, for
the case of nat.zero, then ...

(3) if whenever we have an answer, or the property holds,
for an arbitrary natural number n', we can derive a proof
or answer for the successor of n' (nat.succ n' or n'.succ
or simply n' + 1)

(4) then the property holds, or we have an answer, for
*all* values of type nat.

Suppose you need a proof for n = 3, for example. If
you have an answer for 0, start with that, then you
can apply the method for producing a proof/answer for
the next larger number to 0 to get a proof/answer for
1, then apply it again, etc., until you have the proof
or answer you need for n = 3, or for any n whatsoever.
-/

/-
For the remaining examples involving natural numbers, 
we'll close the namespace in which we've defined our
own local version of nat (same as Lean's) so that we
can take advantage of Lean's definitions of functions
applicable to natural numbers, such as addition.

Lean provides a nice notation for writing proofs
or functions by induction/recursion. Let's rewrite
our sum_up function using it.
-/

def sum_up_to : nat → nat 
| (nat.zero)    := nat.zero
| (nat.succ n') := sum_up_to n' + (n' + 1)

/-
The first rule gives you an answer for the base
case, the second *assumes* you have an answer for
n' and constructs an answer for n' + 1. Now that
you have an answer for the base case and an answer
for the inductive case, you have a definition that
computes a result for *any* natural number, n. 

As an example, consider the input, n = 5. This
value can be expressed as (nat.succ 4) and that
is how to understand the second case. It matches
the argument based on how it was constructed and
pulls out the argument, n'=4, to which nat.succ
was applied to get the 5 given as an argument. 
In this case, the right answer is the sum of 
all the numbers up to n'=4 plus (n'+1)=5. The
answer for 4 is 10, plus 5 is 15, and that is
the result of the recursive computation.

Proofs

/-
In the definition of my_add' we can see 
readily that we have an "answer" for each
of two cases for n, the argument to the
function.

(1) n = nat.zero (first constructor)
(2) n = nat.succ n' for some n' (second constructor)

The difference between case analysis and
induction is that in the inductive case we
can assume that we have an answer (value or
proof) for n', and all we need to give is a
way to construct a proof/result for n' + 1.

The "answers" in turn now serve as additional
axioms that we can use in reasoning. For example,
we can see from the first rule that for any m,
0 + m = m, and it's easy to prove formally.
