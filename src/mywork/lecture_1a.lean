NUMBER SYSTEMS
-/

/-
Mathematicians think about operations on many kinds of objects.
In early mathematics, the objects are numbers. In later maths,
they can be polynomials, matrices, functions, symmetries, or any
manner of other "mathematical thingies". As we're going to see
here, they can even be propositions and proofs.

But let's start with something really simple. The number, 1. Ok,
it's actually not that simple, because 1 can be interpreted as 
denoting a natural number, integer, real number, rational number,
identity matrix, identity function, identity element of a group,
or any manner (again) of "mathematical thingy". If Lean sees a 
bare numeral, 1, it interprets it as the natural number, 1. It
is possible to force many other interpretations however, as the
following examples show.

As you read the code, remember the following (You are expected to know the
symbols and the terminology).

ℕ: Natural numbers. The non-negative whole numbers. {0, 1, 2, ...}
ℤ: Integers: The negative and non-negative whole numbers. 
ℚ: Rationals: Ratios of an integer and a non-zero natural number.
ℝ: Reals: Equivalence classes of convergent sequence of rationals.
Irrational numbers: Real numbers not "isomorphic" to any rationals.

Examples:

Natural numbers:  0, 3, 11, 29
Integers:         -29, 0, 3, 11
Rationals:        1/2, -3/4, 23/7
Reals:            0.000..., .333..., 3.1415...
Irrationals:      3.1415..., e, sqrt 2

def m := 1        -- 1 inferred to be a natural number (built into Lean)
def n : ℕ := 1    -- 1 specified to be a natural number (non-negative whole number)
def z : ℤ := 1    -- 1 as an integer (negative or non-negative whole number)
def r : ℝ := 1.0  -- 1 as a real number (infinite decimal sequence)
def q : ℚ := 1/1  -- 1 as a rational number (fraction)

/-
Each proceeding line of code has the following elements
- def: a keyword, binds the given identifer to the given value
- n, m, z, r, q: identifiers, a.k.a., variables or variable names
- : T, where T is ℕ, ℤ, ℝ, or ℚ: specifies the *type* of the value
- := 1.0: specifies the value, 1.0, to be bound to the identifier 
-/

/-
The same definitions could be written as follows, allowing Lean
to fill in type information that it can infer from the way in
which the values are given.
-/

def m' := 1           -- Lean assumes 1 is a natural number (built into Lean)
def n' := (1 : ℕ)     -- 1 as a natural number (non-negative whole number)
def z' := (1 : ℤ)     -- 1 as an integer (negative or non-negative whole number)
def r' := (1.0 : ℝ)   -- 1 as a real number (infinite decimal sequence)
def q' := 1/1         -- Here Lean infers 1/1 is rational number (fraction)


/-
AXIOMS, PROPOSITIONS, PROOFS
-/

/-
Let's again talk about propositions and 
proofs involving "equality" propositions,
such as the proposition that 1 = 1. We
all *know* intuitively that 1 = 1, but
how would you prove it, given that it's
not an axiom of ordinary predicate logic?


Without getting into the weeds, suffice
it to say that the standard Lean Prover
libraries define equality pretty much as 
we've discussed here: with an axiom in 
the form of a universal generaliztion: 
∀ {T : Type} (t : T), t = t.

In English, this says, "if you give me 
*any* Type, T, and any object, t, of that
type, I will return you (and therefore 
there must be) a proof of the proposition, 
t = t; and the existence of this proof,
in turn, justifies the *judgment* that
the proposition, 1 = 1, is *true*.  

Let's take another look at the axiom that
let's us *deduce* the *theorem* that 1 = 1.
Here it is: ∀ {T : Type} (t : T), t = t.
What that means is that if I choose any
type, T, say T = ℕ, and any value of that
type, say t = (1 : ℕ), then I should be 
able to apply the axiom to the argument
values, ℕ and 1, to get back a *proof* of
the proposition, 1 = 1. 

Indeed, that's just how it works, as the
follow example shows formally (in Lean).
-/

example : 1 = 1 := 
  eq.refl 1   -- Lean inferns T = ℕ from 1

/-
Yay! We just constructed a formal proof: a
mathematical object that certifies that 1=1. 
It might not be super-impressive that Lean 
rejects "eq.refl 2" as a suitable proof (try
it, and don't fail to read the entire error
message when you hover your cursor over the
red squiggle!); but the principle extends to 
commplex proofs of profound propositions. 

Nice: you've not only constructed a formal 
proof object but you have a "high assurance" 
check that the proof itself is correct, in
that Lean actually accepts that it's correct. 
*That* is what Lean is really for: not just 
for formalizing mathematics and logic, but 
for checking that proofs *truly* prove what
they claim to prove. 
-/

/-
Of course, if formal proofs came without 
costs, we'd all be using them. The benefit 
of a *natural language* "proof description"
(written in, say, English, but in a highly
mathematical style) is that it's easier for
people to follow, often because details can
be elided on the assumption that the reader
will know from context what is meant. 

In this case at hand, you could give a proof, 
of the proposition, 1 = 1, as follows:

If an axiom of equality is that everything is equal
to itself, then one is also equal to itself

Proof: By the reflexive property of equality
(applied to the particular value, 1). QED." 

If you and your audience both understand that
you're *applying* the universal generalization
given as an axiom to suitable values, then you
can just leave out the parenthetical expression.
How much detail to put in a proof description
is a matter of style and of a willingness to
make your readers fill in the missing details. 

The QED, by the way, is short for quod est 
demonstratum, Latin for "it is shown." It is
a kind of traditional punctuation for natural
language proof descriptions that signals that 
the proof is complete.

The downside of using natural language proof
descriptions in lieu of formal proof objects
is that when things get complex, it can be 
nearly impossible to tell whether a proof in
natural language is correct or not. In hard
cases, it can require years of work by world
experts to decide whether a proof is correct
or faulty.

In this class, we will insist, because all
mathematicians do, that your propositions 
be fully formal, i.e., syntactically correct
by the grammatical rules of predicate logic, 
as enforced by Lean. We will expose you to 
formal proofs to the extent that we believe
that doing so will help you to understand
how to write quasi-formal proof descriptions.

Quasi-formal proofs are what most people use
today, including instructors for follow-on CS
courses. But there are now thriving communities
in both mathematics and computer science that
are aggressively pursuing the formalization,
and the *computerization* of logic and proof.
The community around Lean is most interested
in formalizing mathematics for mathematicians.
Other critically important applications of 
Lean and similar "proof assistants" arise in
relation to the definition of programming
languages, and in the formal (mathematical)
specification and trustworthy and automated 
correctness checking of computer programs.

/-
If you're getting the feeling that we are
pointing you a little bit to a computational
understand of what it means to construct or
to use proofs, you're right. To make the point
clearer, let's write our own proof-returning 
function@ We'll call it gimme_a_proof. It 
will take two arguments, a type, T, and a 
value, t, of that type; and it will return 
a proof of t = t, on the basis of which we
can render the judgment that t = t is *true*.
-/

def gimme_a_proof   -- function name
    (T : Type)      -- first argument
    (t : T)         -- second argument
    : t = t         -- return type 
    := eq.refl t    -- implementation

/-
Let's decode that. We're defining a function
called gimme_a_proof that takes T and t as 
its arguments and promises to return a value 
of type t = t (a proof of this proposition).
The way that it upholds this promise is by
*applying* eq.refl to t, whatever it is, to 
construct a proof of t = t. That proof is the
result and return value of this function. 
-/

/-
Now that we've got this function defined, 
we can apply *it* to arguments to have it
construct values that constitute proofs of 
t = t. If you hover over #reduce in the 
following Lean commands, Lean will report
to you the results of applying the function
to arguments of various numerical types.
Remember when reading the outputs that
"eq.refl x" *is* an object that serves 
as a proof of x = x
-/

#reduce gimme_a_proof ℕ 9
#reduce gimme_a_proof bool tt
#reduce gimme_a_proof ℚ 1
#reduce gimme_a_proof ℤ (-3)

That wraps up this review (and extension)
of our last lecture. Now for the quiz.

/-++++++++++
EXERCISES #1.
Give a quasi-formal English language "proof" 
of the proposition that 2 = 2.

Theorem: 2 = 2.
Proof: By the reflexive property of equality applied to the number 2, 2 = 2

-/


/-++++++++++
EXERCISE #2.
Give, below, a formal statement and proof of 
the proposition, 2 = 2. (See above for a good
example to follow!)

-- answer here

example : 2 = 2 := eq.refl 2


/-
EXERCISE #3.
Identify what form of reasoning is being used 
in each of the following made-up stories. Just
give a one-word answer for each.

A. Every time the bell has rung, I've gotten a
nugget. The bell just rung, so I'm gonna get a
nugget! (Dogs usually say "gonna," by the way).

answer: 

B. The "clone repo into container" command did
nothing. That was clearly wrong. I search around
on the World Wide Web and notice someone saying
something about that VSCode command needed to 
have git installed. Ah ha, I thought. That could
be it. I'll do the obvious experiment and install
git and see if it works. (It did, by the way.)

answer: 

C. It's true that it's raining, and it's true
that the streets are wet, so it must be true 
that "it's raining *and* the streets are wet."

answer:
