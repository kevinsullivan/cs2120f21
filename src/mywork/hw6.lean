Assume X and L are sets of type α. We must prove that
X ∪ L = L ∪ X. The first step is to convert the proof to now 
need to prove for all x of type α, x ∈ L ∪ X ↔ x ∈ X ∪ L. 
From here we can apply the introduction rule of ↔ to split
into two proofs : x ∈ L ∪ X → x ∈ X ∪ L and 
x ∈ X ∪ L → x ∈ L ∪ X. For the first proof, we assume we have a 
proof of x ∈ L ∪ X. From here we can do a case analysis of this proof
to prove x ∈ X ∪ L for x ∈ L and x ∈ X. For x ∈ L we can use the
right introduction rule for or on d to require a proof of
x ∈ L which we already have a proof of. Then, for x ∈ X, for we can use the 
left introdcution rule for on on x ∈ X ∪ L to require a proof of x ∈ X which
we already have a proof of. Thus we have proven the first implication.
For the second implication we assume a proof of x ∈ X ∪ L. From 
here we can use the elimination rule of or on x ∈ X ∪ L to have 
x ∈ L and x ∈ X. If we prove x ∈ L ∪ X for both then the overall
implication is true. Starting with x ∈ L we can apply the left introduction 
rule for or on x ∈ L ∪ X to prove x ∈ L which we already have a proof of. 
for x ∈ X we can apply the right introduction rule of or to x ∈ L ∪ X to
only prove x ∈ X which we already have a proof of. Thus the implication
is true. By proving both implications the overall ↔ is proved. QED

Assume A B and C are sets of type α. Show that if A is a subset of B and B is a
subset of C then A is a subset of C. First assume A is a subset of B, then assume
B is a subset of C. Then rewrite A ⊆ C as ∀ (x : α), x ∈ A → x ∈ C. Assume x is 
of type α and assume x is in A. Then use the proof of A ⊆ B to show x ∈ B. Next, 
use the proof of B ⊆ C to show that x ∈ C. Therefore A ⊆ C is true.

Assume A B and C are sets of type α. Prove (A ∪ B) ∪ C = A ∪ (B ∪ C). 
This can be converted to say for all x of type α, x ∈ (A ∪ B) ∪ C ↔ x ∈ A ∪ (B ∪ C). 
From here apply the introduction rule for iff to seperately prove
x ∈ (A ∪ B) ∪ C → x ∈ A ∪ (B ∪ C) and x ∈ A ∪ (B ∪ C) → x ∈ (A ∪ B) ∪ C. 

First direction:
Assume a proof of x ∈ (A ∪ B) ∪ C. From this a case study of this proof 
will say that if x ∈ A ∪ (B ∪ C) can be proven for x ∈ A, x ∈ B, x ∈ C then
the overall implication is true by the or elimination rule.
x ∈ A:
Assume a proof of x ∈ A. From here apply the left or elimination rule to 
x ∈ A ∪ (B ∪ C) to only need to prove x ∈ A which we already have a proof of.
x ∈ B:
Assume a proof of x ∈ B. From here apply the right elemination rule then the 
left elimination rule of or to x ∈ A ∪ (B ∪ C) to only need a proof of x ∈ B. 
We already have a proof of this by assumption. 
X ∈ C: 
Assume a proof of x ∈ C. From here apply the right elimination rule of or to
x ∈ A ∪ (B ∪ C) twice to only need a proof of x ∈ C. We already have a proof of 
this by assumption. 
The first implication is true. 

Second direction:
Assume a proof of x ∈ A ∪ (B ∪ C). From this a case study will say that
if x ∈ (A ∪ B) ∪ C can be proven for x ∈ A, x ∈ B, and x ∈ C, the overall 
implication will also be true by the or elimination rule. 
x ∈ a: 
Assume a proof of x ∈ A. From this apply the left elimination rule of or to 
x ∈ (A ∪ B) ∪ C twice to only need a proof of x ∈ A. We already have a proof of 
this by assumption.
x ∈ B:
Assume a proof of x ∈ B. From this apply the left elimination rule and the
right elimination rule of or to x ∈ (A ∪ B) ∪ C to only need a proof of x ∈ B.
This proof already exists by assumption. 
x ∈ C:
Assume a proof of x ∈ C. From this apply the right elimination rule of or to 
x ∈ (A ∪ B) ∪ C to only need a proof of x ∈ C. This proof already exists by

Assume A B and C are sets of type α. Prove (A ∩ B) ∩ C = A ∩ (B ∩ C). 
This can be rewritten as for all x of type α,

First direction:
Assume a proof of x ∈ (A ∩ B) ∩ C. By applying the and elimination rule

The introduction rule of and can be used on x ∈ B and x ∈ C to construct a 
proof of x ∈ B ∩ C. From here the introduction rule of and can be used again
on x ∈ A and x ∈ B ∩ C to construct a proof of x ∈ A ∩ (B ∩ C). This

Second direction:

Assume A B and C are sets of type α. Prove A ∪ (B ∩ C) = (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C). 
This can be rewritten to say for all x of type α 
x ∈ A ∪ (B ∩ C) ↔ x ∈ (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C). The introduction rule for ↔ splits this
into two proofs; x ∈ A ∪ (B ∩ C) → x ∈ (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C) and 
x ∈ (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C) → x ∈ A ∪ (B ∩ C)

First direction:
Assume a proof of x ∈ A ∪ (B ∩ C). Use a case study to prove x ∈ (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C)
for x ∈ A and x ∈ B ∩ C seperately by the or elimination rule. 

x ∈ A:
Assume a proof of x ∈ A. Use the and introduction rule to split x ∈ (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C)
to seperately prove x ∈ (A ∪ B) and x ∈ (A ∪ C). For both the left introduction rule
for or can be used to only need a proof of x ∈ A which we already have. Therefore
this case is true. 

x ∈ B ∩ C:
Assume a proof of x ∈ B ∩ C. Use the elimination rule for and to create seperate proofs
of x ∈ B and x ∈ C. From here apply the and introduction rule to x ∈ (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C)
to split it into seperate proofs of x ∈ (A ∪ B) and x ∈ (A ∪ C). From here
applying the right introduction rule for or to each means it will suffice to 
prove x ∈ B and x ∈ C respectively. Proofs for both already exist, therefore
this case is true

Both cases are true, therefore the overall implication is true. 

Second direction: 
Assume a proof of x ∈ (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C). Using the elimination rule for and
seperate proofs of x ∈ A ∪ B and A ∪ C can be constructed. First do a case study
on A ∪ B to show that it suffices to prove A ∪ (B ∩ C) with x ∈ A and x ∈ B 
seperately. 

x ∈ A:
Assume a proof of x ∈ A. From here apply the left elimination rule of or to
A ∪ (B ∩ C) to only need a proof of x ∈ A. A proof of this exists by assumption,
therefore this case is true.

x ∈ B:
Assume a proof of x ∈ B. This proof alone cannot prove A ∪ (B ∩ C). Therefor we do
a case study on x ∈ A ∪ C to prove A ∪ (B ∩ C) with x ∈ A and x ∈ C seperately. 

  x ∈ A:
  Assume a proof of x ∈ A. From here apply the left elimination rule of or to
  A ∪ (B ∩ C) to only need a proof of x ∈ A. A proof of this exists by assumption,
  therefore this case is true. 

  x ∈ C:
  Assume a proof of x ∈ C. From here apply the introduction rule for and to 
  x ∈ B and x ∈ C to construct a proof of x ∈ B ∩ C. Next, apply the right
  introduction rule of or to A ∪ (B ∩ C) to show that it suffices to prove 
  x ∈ B ∩ C. This proof already exists, therefore this case is true. 

Both cases within x ∈ B were true therefore this case is true. 

Both cases are true, therefore this implication is true. 

Because both implications were true, the overall ↔ is true as well.
