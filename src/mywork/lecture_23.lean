CLOSURE operations on relations.

Given a relation, r, the reflexive, symmetric, or
transitive closure of r is the smallest relation that
(1) contains r, and (2) contains any additional pairs
needed to make the resulting relation reflexive, or
symmetric, or transitive, respectively. The reflexive,
symmetric, transitive closure of r is the smallest
relation (which means *no* unnecessary added pairs)
that contains r and has all three properties. Note
that the resulting relation will be an equivalence
relation. The meaning of this is basically that if
anything is connecting to somethiing else, they will
end up in the same "equivalence class." We'll see a
picture.

def reflexive_closure := λ (a b : β), (r a b) ∨ (a = b)
def symmetric_closure := λ (a b : β), (r a b) ∨ (r b a)

/-
Let's look examples. What's in the reflexive closure
of { (0,1), (1,2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5) }? It is 
often easier to think about these things with the aid
of a picture, so let's draw this relation and see in
graphical terms what it means to compute its reflexive
closure.
-/

/- 
The definitions of the reflexive and symmetric closures
of a relation are pretty easy to state. It's a little 
harder to say what set of pairs is in the transitive
closure of a given relation, r. Clearly it's a relation, 
r', where r' is the smallest relation that contains r 
and that is transitive. In other words, (tc r) is r
with any additional pairs needed to make the result
transitive.

What set of pairs is this? Well, (1) it contains every
pair in r, and (2) if (a,b) is in (tc r) and if (b, c)
is in (tc r), then (a, c) must also be in r. The way we
will say this formally uses what we call an inductive
definition. Inductive definitions allow for "bigger"
things to be built whenever there are smaller things
of the right kind.

Consider this relation, r = { (0,1), (1,2), (2, 3) }.
It's transitive closure clearly contains all three of
these pairs. What else must it include at a minimum to
be transitive?

Consider r = { (0,1), (1,2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5) }.
What is its transitive closure?

In plain English, if there's a "path" of pairs between 
two values, a and c, e.g., by way of b where (a,b) and 
(b,c) are in the relation, then (a,c) will also be in
the relation, i.e., the direct connection, (a,c), will
also be in the relation. 

The following formal definition is not one that I 
expect you to understand immediately, as we have not
yet introduced iductive definitions, of which this is
an example. But you can just read it as definining
the introduction rules, base and trans, for proving
one relation is the transitive closure of another, r.

The first rule says that if any two objects, a and b,
are related in r, then they are also related in tc r
(the transitive closure of r). The second rule says 
that if objects a and b are related in (tc r) and b
and c are related in (tc r) then a and c must also 
be related in r. For any length-2 "path" from a to c
(via b), then there's a direct connection: (a,c) ∈ r.

/-
Here's a possibly surprising fact: the transitive 
closure concept *cannot be expressed, defined, nor the
concept used, in first-order predicate logic*. The
reason is that you can't quantify over relations, and
so cannot write "for any relation, r, it's transitive 
closure is ..." Quantifying over relations just isn't
allowed: it's not even part of the syntax of first-
order predicate logic.

Yet what we've written, formally and understandably, is
a concept essential in all kinds of logical reasoning in 
computer science. That suggests something about teaching
first-order logic as a first logic for computer science:
there's real reason to doubt that it's the best choice.
The higher-order predicate logic of Lean and similar
modern proof assistants is strictly more expressive.

Problem #1: Formally prove and give an English
language proof of the proposition that the identity
relation, on objects of an arbitrary type, β, is a
subrelation of any equivalence relation on β. 
-/

example : ∀ (β : Type) (r : β → β → Prop),
  equivalence r → subrelation relations.id_relation r := 
begin
  unfold equivalence subrelation reflexive relations.id_relation,
  assume β r h x y k,
  cases h with refl rest,
  rw <-k,
  exact refl x,
end

/-
Suppose r is a equivalence relation. To show that the
identity relation is a subrelation of r, we have to show
that for any pair, (x, y), in the identity relation, that
same pair is in r. Of course the identity relation has 
all and only the pairs of the form, (x, x), so all we 
need to show is that any such pair is also in r. But r
is reflexive, so by definition, for any x, (x, x) ∈ r. 
So (x,y) ∈ id_relation → (x, x) ∈ r. And that is what
it means for the identity relation to be a subrelation
of r. As r was arbitrary, the identity relation is a
subrelation of *any* equivalence relation on r. QED.
