# Predicate Logic and Relations through Equality

Equality is defined for all objects of all types
by just two inference rules, which we accept as
axioms. 

- the axiom of the *reflexivity of equality*
- the axiom of the *substitutability of equals*

We've seen the first (the reflexivity of equality).
In today's class, we'll quickly review the first,
then we'll introduce the second axiom. The comes
the real eye-opener: we will use these two axioms
to construct proofs of two theorems about equality:

- theorem: the equality relation is *symmetric*
- theorem: the equality relation is *transitive*

## Properties of relations

Speaking informally, when we say that a relation,
such as equality, is *symmetric* we're mean that,
for all objects, x and y, of any type T, if x is
related to y, then y is symmetrically related to x.

If the relation in question is equality, then what
it means for equality to be symmetric is that *if*
x = y (for *any* x and y of any type), then y = x.

By transitive, we mean that if x is related to y
and y is related to z, then x is related to z.

Example: Consider the friends relation on people
in Facebook. Is it reflexive? symmetric? transitive?

Example: Consider the "has a crush on" relation
on people. Is it reflexive? symmetric? Transitive?

Example: Consider the less than relation on
natural numbers. Is it symmetric? Transitive?

Example: Consider the less than or equal relation
on natural numbers. Is it Symmetric? Transitive?

## The reflexivity of equality is an axiom

You've already learned the reflexivity axiom
for equality: ∀ (T : Type) (t : T), t = t.

A direct translation could be, "Given any
type, T, and any object, t, of that type,
t is equal to itself." Put more succinctly,
"Every thing is equal to itself." But best
of all, "Equality is a *reflexive* relation."

## Propositions and predicates

These concepts are fundamental in all logics.

### Propositions

A proposition is a claim that can be judged
to be true or not. In mathemtical logic, a
proposition can be judged to be true if and
only if it is either an axiom, or a proof of
it can be derived by application of inference
rules to axioms.

Example: 3 = 4

- Truth value: false
- Proof: a false proposition has no proofs (else it'd be true!)

Example: 3 = 3

- Truth value: true
- Proof:
  - Informal: By the reflexivity of equality (for natural numbers)
  - Formal (in Lean): *eq.refl 3*
- Note: Each type (e.g., nat) has its own equality relation

Example: CVille is a city in Virginia

- Truth value: true
- Proof (evidence): city, county, state codes

Example: Kevin Sullivan is from Charlottesville

- Truth value: false
- Proof: none

### Predicates

A predicate is a parameterized proposition. In other words,
it is a proposition with some *arguments*, which is to say,
slots where you can fill in values of specified types.

Examples:

- predicate P: _X_ is a city in Virginia
  - fill in a value for _X_ to get a proposition
  - the resulting proposition could be true or not
  - if true of some _X_, _X_ "has the property of being a city in VA"
- predicate Q: _X_ is from Charlottesville
- predicate eq3: _X_ = 3
  - fill in a value (here a natural number) for _X_ to get a proposition
  - if true, then _X_ "has the property of being equal to 3"
  - of course there is a number, 3, that *satisfies* this predicate

Suppose that for predicates P and Q, the type of 
_X_ is string. You can then *apply* either predicate,
P or Q, to a string to get a resulting proposition.

For example, (Q "Kevin") produces the proposition,
Kevin Sullivan is from Charlottesville, while (e3 2)
produces the proposition 2 = 3.  

You can think of a predicate as a function: one that
takes values of given types as arguments and that returns
a *proposition* with the argument values plugged in where
the predicate had its formal parameters. A predicate really
is like a function that returns a proposition: it takes one
or more values as arguments, and returns a proposition that
makes an assertion *about* those values, as a result.

### Predicates as functions

Speaking formally, we represent a predicate exactly as a
function. In the case of the predicate e3, it's a function
that takes a natural number, n, and returns the proposition,
n = 3. Here's what this function looks like in Lean.

def e3 (n : nat) : Prop := n = 3

Applying e3 to 2, for example, yields the proposition,
2 = 3. This proposition is "about 2" in the sense that
it claims (falsely) that 2 has the property of being equal
to 3. The proposition has no proofs given that the only proofs
of equality we can construct are proofs that a value is
equal to itself. Implicit in this informal argument is the
assumption that 2 and 3 are different objects (which they
are, but that requires a discussion of the axioms that
define the natural numbers, which we'll skip for now).
So we can conclude that 2 does not have the property of
being equal to 3, and the proposition, (e3 2), i.e.,
2 = 3, is false.

## Constructing proofs of equality (introduction rule)

You've already learned the reflexivity axiom
for equality: ∀ (T : Type) (t : T), t = t.

A direct translation could be, "Given any
type, T, and any object, t, of that type,
t is equal to itself." Put more succinctly,
"Every thing is equal to itself." But best
of all, "Equality is a *reflexive* relation."

## Using proofs of equality (elimination rule)

We now turn to the second of the two axioms that
define equality: the axiom of the *substitutability
of equals*. This axioms is not used to create proofs
of equality but gives us a way to *use* a proof of
an equality in the construction of a different kind
of proof: to deduce, for any predicate, P, that if
(P x) is true, and x = y  is true, then (P y) must
also be true.

Example. If "Kevin is from Cville" and Kevin = Bob,
then we can deduce that "Bob is from Cville."

Example: If we know that (x + 2) = 7, and we also
know that "x = y," then we can conclude that y + 2
= 7.

In other words, the second axiom gives us a license
to *rewrite* propositions by replacing one term with
another as long as we can prove a proof of equality
as an argument. 

Here's the idea presented in the formal language
of predicate logic.

``` lean
axiom eq_subst :    -- arguments are assumptions!
  ∀ (T : Type)      -- if we're given, T, a type
    (P : T → Prop)  -- P, property of T objects (predicate)
    (x y : T)       -- x and y, objects of type T,
    (e : x = y)     -- e, a proof of x = y (we *use* an = proof)
    (px : P x),     -- a proof that x has property P
  P y               -- then we can have a proof of P y
```

Given any type, T, and any *property*, P, of objects
of this type (P : T \to Prop), if you know (x : T)
has property P (written as P x) and you know that
x = y, then you can deduce P y: y has property P.

Example:

In the context of the following assumptions ...

``` lean
axioms
  T : Type := nat
  (P : T → Prop)
  (x y : T)
  (e : x = y)
  (px : P x)
```

Can we prove P y?

English: We've assumed P x and x = y, so P y must be
true by the (axiom of the) substitutability of equals.

Formal:

``` lean
example : P y := eq_subst T P x y e px
```

So that's it as far as the axioms of equality are concerned.

/-
TRANSITIVITY.

If x, y, and z are objects of some type, T, and we
know (have proofs or axioms) that x = y and y = z,
then we can deduce (and have a proof) that x = z.

Challenge problem: prove (informally) that equality
is transitive!

In super-plain English, this rule says that
if some proposition P about x, (P x), is true
and you also know that x and y are equal, you
can then deduce (P y): that the proposition,
modified to be about y, must also be true. In
short, if you know P x and x = y then you can
deduce that P y must also be true.

You ask, what do you mean, "What you can do
with a proof?" And the answer is that you
can use it as evidence that shows that it's
ok to make a particular logical deduction.

Let's assume for a moment that we've been
given a type, T, such as nat or bool. What
the axioms then do in effect is to define
equality as a binary relation on T.
