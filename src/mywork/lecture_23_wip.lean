ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES OF RELATIONS

section relation

/-
Define relation, r, as two-place predicate on 
a type, β, with notation, x ≺ y, for (r x y). 
-/
variables {α β : Type}  (r : β → β → Prop)
local infix `≺`:50 := r  

-- special relations on an arbitrary type, α 
def empty_relation := λ a₁ a₂ : α, false
def full_relation := λ a₁ a₂ : α, true
def id_relation :=  λ a₁ a₂ : α, a₁ = a₂ 

-- Analog of the subset relation but now on binary relations
-- Note: subrelation is a binary relation on binary relations
def subrelation (q r : β → β → Prop) := ∀ ⦃x y⦄, q x y → r x y

def total := ∀ x y, x ≺ y ∨ y ≺ x

Note: we will use "total" later to refer to a different
property of relations that also satisfy the constraints
needed to be "functions."

def anti_reflexive := ∀ x, ¬ x ≺ x --different from not reflexive 
                                   --i.e. less than
def irreflexive := anti_reflexive r -- sometimes used
def anti_symmetric := ∀ ⦃x y⦄, x ≺ y → y ≺ x → x = y
def asymmetric := ∀ ⦃x y⦄, x ≺ y → ¬ y ≺ x 

-- Exercises:
/-
- Name a common anti_symmetric relation in arithmetic
less than or equal to 
- Name a common asymmetric relation in arithmetic
less than

example : reflexive r → ¬ asymmetric r := _   -- true?
example : ¬ reflexive r ↔ irreflexive r := _ -- true?

provide formal definition of each of the following properties of a binary relation, 
r, on objects of a type, β. We will call r 

– a quasiordering if r is reflexive and transitive;
– a strict (or sharp) ordering if r is irreflexive and transitive;
– a near-ordering if r is anti_symmetic and transitive;
– a (reflexive) ordering if r is reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive;
– a tolerance if r is reflexive and symmetric;
– * an equivalence if r is reflexive, symmetric and transitive

def ordering := reflexive r ∧ transitive r ∧ anti_symmetric r -- new
def strict_ordering := asymmetric r ∧ transitive r
def partial_order := reflexive r ∧ anti_symmetric r ∧ transitive r ∧ ¬ total r
def total_order := reflexive r ∧ anti_symmetric r ∧ transitive r ∧ total r

Definitions vary subtly. Be sure you know what is meant by these terms in any
given setting or application.
