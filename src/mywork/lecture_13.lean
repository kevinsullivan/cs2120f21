UPDATE: Test distributed after class on 
Monday. Monday will be a review day. The
test is due back Wednesday before class.
In class Wednesday we will have at least
a short quiz to sanity check what you will
have submitted for the test. We reserve the
right to do follow-on in-person testing if
the results indicate a possible problem.

REVIEW: Last time we focused on the question, 
how do we construct a proof of ∃ x, P x.  

To do so, you apply the introduction rule for
exists. It's called exists.intro in Lean. You
apply it to two arguments: a specific value, w,
in place of x, and a proof that that particular
w satisfies the predicate, P, i.e., that there 
is a proof of the proposition, P w. 

In other words, you can think of a proof of
∃ x, P x, as a pair, ⟨w, pf ⟩, where w is a
witness and pf is a proof of P w.

Today we'll delve deeper into the mysteries
of exists elimination, or how you can *use*
a proof of ∃ x, P x.

Here's the idea: If you have a proof, ex, of
of ∃ (x : X), P x, you can apply exists.elim
to ex, and (after a few more simple maneuvers)
have yourself a specific value, (w : X), and 
a proof that w satisfies P, i.e., (pf : P w). 
The idea is that you can then uses the values
in your subsequent proof steps.

Why does this rule make sense? Consider a very
simple example. If I tell you there exists some
green ball, you can say, "well, call it b," and
give that we know it's green, we also know that
it satisfies the isGreen _ predicate, so we can
also assume we have a proof of (isGreen b). In
this example, b is a witness to the fact that
some object satisfies the predicate. The proof
then shows for sure that that is so.

example : ∃ (b : bool), b && tt = ff :=
begin
  apply exists.intro ff,
  apply eq.refl,
end

example : (exists (b : bool), b && tt = ff) → (∃ (b : bool), true) :=
begin
  assume h,
  cases h with w pf,
  apply exists.intro w,
  trivial,
end

Let's set up some assumptions so that 
we can explore their consequences when
it comes to existentially quantified
propositions.
