UPDATE: Test distributed after class on 
Monday. Monday will be a review day. The
test is due back Wednesday before class.
In class Wednesday we will have at least
a short quiz to sanity check what you will
have submitted for the test. We reserve the
right to do follow-on in-person testing if
the results indicate a possible problem.

REVIEW: Last time we focused on the question, 
how do we construct a proof of ∃ x, P x.  

To do so, you apply the introduction rule for
exists. It's called exists.intro in Lean. You
apply it to two arguments: a specific value, w,
in place of x, and a proof that that particular
w satisfies the predicate, P, i.e., that there 
is a proof of the proposition, P w. 

In other words, you can think of a proof of
∃ x, P x, as a pair, ⟨w, pf ⟩, where w is a
witness and pf is a proof of P w.

/-
Today we'll delve deeper into the mysteries
of exists elimination, or how you can *use*
a proof of ∃ x, P x.

Here's the idea: If you have a proof, ex, of
of ∃ (x : X), P x, you can apply exists.elim
to ex, and (after a few more simple maneuvers)
have yourself a specific value, (w : X), and 
a proof that w satisfies P, i.e., (pf : P w). 
The idea is that you can then uses the values
in your subsequent proof steps.

Why does this rule make sense? Consider a very
simple example. If I tell you there exists some
green ball, you can say, "well, call it b," and
give that we know it's green, we also know that
it satisfies the isGreen _ predicate, so we can
also assume we have a proof of (isGreen b). In
this example, b is a witness to the fact that
some object satisfies the predicate. The proof
then shows for sure that that is so.

example : ∃ (b : bool), b && tt = ff :=
begin
  apply exists.intro ff _,
  exact eq.refl _, --or refl which is a type of eq.refl that infers or trivial which does some basic stuff
end

example : (exists (b : bool), b && tt = ff) → (∃ (b : bool), true) :=
begin
  assume h,
  cases h with w pf, --backing out the arguments we need to have our exists proof
  apply exists.intro w,
  trivial,
end

example : (∃ (b : bool), true) :=
begin
  --exact exists.intro tt true.intro,
  apply exists.intro tt,
  trivial,

Let's set up some assumptions so that 
we can explore their consequences when
it comes to existentially quantified

there is someone whom everyone who is nice 
likes.
