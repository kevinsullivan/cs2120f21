In today's class, we'll continue with our
exploration of the proposition, "false", 
its elimination rule, and their vital uses
in logical reasoning: especially in  

- proof of ¬P by negation
- proof of P by false elimination

Here are the inference rules in display
notation:

NEGATION INTRODUCTION

The first, proof by negation, says that
from a proof of P → false you can derive
a proof of ¬P. Indeed! It's definitional.
Recall: def not (P : Prop) := P → false.

  (P : Prop) (np : P → false)
  --------------------------- [by defn'n]
            (pf : ¬P)

This rule is the foundation for "proof by
negation." To prove ¬P you first assume P,
is true, then you show that in this context
you can derive a contradiction. What you
have then shown, of course, is P → false.

So, to prove ¬P, assume P and show that in
this context there is a contradiction. 
This is proof by negation. It is not to be
confused with proof by contradition, which
is a different thing entirely. 

(Proof by contradiction. You can use this
approach to a proposition, P, by assuming
¬P and showing that this assumption leads
to a contradiction. That proves ¬¬P. Then 
you use the *indepedent* axiom of negation 
elimination to infer P from ¬¬P.)

FALSE ELIMINATION

The second rule says that if you have a
proof of false and any other proposition,
P, the logic is useless and so you might
as well just admit that P is true. Why is
the logic useless? Well, if false is true
then there's no longer a difference! In
this situation, tHere's sense in reasoning
any further, and you can just dismiss it.
A contradiction makes a logic inconsistent.

  (P : Prop) (f : false)
  ---------------------- (false_elim f)
        (pf : P)

We covered the relatively simpler notion of
negation introduction last time, so today we
will start by focusing on false elimination.
Understanding why it's not magic and in fact 
makes perfect sense takes a bit of thought.
-/

/-
To make sense of false elimination, think in 
terms of case analysis. Proof by case analysis 
says that if the truth of some proposition, Y,
follows from *any possible form of proof* of X, 
then you've proved X → Y. 

If X is a disjunction, P ∨ Q (so now you want 
to prove P ∨ Q → Y) you must consider two cases:
one where P is assumed true and one where Q is
assumed true. 

If X is a proposition with just one form of
proof (e.g., the proposition, true), there's
just one case to consider. 
-/

-- two cases
example : true ∨ false → true :=
begin
  assume h,
  cases h,
  assumption,     -- context has exact proof
  contradiction,  -- context has contradiction
end

-- one case
example : true → true :=
begin
  assume t, 
  cases t,        -- just one case
  exact true.intro,
end

/-
How many cases must you consider if you putatively 
have a putative proof of false? ZERO! To consider
*all* cases you need consider exactly zero cases.
Proving all cases when the number of cases is zero 
is trivial, so the conclusion *follows*. 
-/

example : false → false :=
begin
  assume f,
  cases f,    -- case analysis: there are no cases!
end

/-
In fact, it doesn't matter what your conclusion
is: it will always be true in a context in which
you have a proof of false. And this makes sense,
because if you have a proof of false, then false
is true, so whether a given proposition is true 
or false, it's true, because even if it's false,
well, false is true, so it's also true!

theorem false_elim : ∀ (P : Prop), false → P :=
begin
  assume P,
  assume f,
  cases f,
end

/-
This, then, is the general principle for false
elimination: ANYTHING FOLLOWS FROM FALSE. This
principle gives you a powerful way to prove any
proposition is true (conditional on your having 
a proof that can't exist). 

The theorem states that if you're given any
proposition, P, and a proof, f, of false, then
in that context, you can return a proof of P by
using false elimination. The only problem with
this super-power is that in reality, there is no
proof of false, so there's no real danger of any
old proposition being automatically true! The
rule of false elimination tells you that if 
you're in a situation that can't happen, then
no worries, be happy, you're done (just use
false elimination).
-/

/-
The elimination principle for false is called 
false.elim in Lean. If you are given or can
derive a proof, f, of false, then all you have
to do to finish your proof is to say, "this is
situation can't happen, so we need not consider
it any further." Or, formally, (false.elim f). 
-/

-- Suppose P is *any* (an arbitrary) proposition 
axiom P : Prop

example : false → P :=
begin
  assume f,
  exact false.elim f, -- Using Lean's version
                      -- P is implicit argument
end

SOME THEOREMS INVOLVING FALSE AND NEGATION
-/

theorem no_contradiction : ∀ (P : Prop), ¬(P ∧ ¬P) :=
begin
  assume P,
  apply not.intro,
  assume pnp,
  have p : P := and.elim_left pnp,
  have np : P → false := and.elim_right pnp,
  contradiction,
end

/-
The so-called "law" (it's really an axiom) of the
excluded middle says that any proposition is either
true or false. There's no middle ground. But in the
constructive logic of Lean, this isn't true. 

To prove P ∨ ¬P, as you recall, we need to have 
either a proof of P (in this case  use or.intro_left)
or a proof of ¬P, in which case we use or.intro_right
to prove P ∨ ¬P. But what if we don't have a proof
either way?

There are many important questions in computer science
and mathematics where we don't know either way. If you
call one of those propositions, P, and try to prove P
∨ ¬P in Lean, you just get stuck.
-/
theorem excluded_middle' : ∀ (P : Prop), (P ∨ ¬P) :=
begin
  assume P,
  apply or.intro_right,
  apply not.intro,
  assume p,
  --dont have a proof of P or ¬P
end

/-
Let P be the conjecture, "every even whole number 
greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers."
This conjecture, dating (in a slightly different
form) to a letter from Goldback to Euler in 1742
is still neither proved nor disproved! Below you
will find a placeholder for a proof. Just fill it
in (correctly) and you will win $1M and probably 
a Fields Medal (the "Nobel Prize" in mathematics). 
-/

axioms (ev : ℕ → Prop) (prime : ℕ → Prop)

def goldbach_conjecture := 
  ∀ (n : ℕ), 
    n > 2 → 
    (∃ h k : ℕ, n = h + k ∧ prime h ∧ prime k)

theorem goldbach_conjecture_true : goldbach_conjecture := _
theorem goldbach_conjecture_false : ¬goldbach_conjecture := _

example : goldbach_conjecture ∨ ¬goldbach_conjecture := _
/-
Our only options are or.intro_left or or.intro_right, but
we don't have a required argument (proof) to use either of
them!
-/ 

/-
The axioms of the constructive logic of Lean are not
strong enough to prove the "law of the excluded middle."
Rather, if we want to use it, we have to accept it as
an additional axiom. We thus have two different logics:
one without and one with the law of the excluded middle!
-/
axiom excluded_middle : ∀ (P : Prop), (P ∨ ¬P)

/-
Now, for any proposition whatsoever, P, we can always
prove P ∨ ¬P by applying excluded middle to P (using
the elimination rule for ∀). What we get in return is
a proof of P ∨ ¬P for whatever proposition P is. Here
is an example where the proposition is ItsRaining.

-/
axiom ItsRaining : Prop
theorem example_em : ItsRaining ∨ ¬ItsRaining := 
begin
  apply excluded_middle ItsRaining,
end

/-
PROOF BY NEGATION, EXAMPLE
-/

/-
Next we return to the negation connective, which
in logic is pronounced "not." Given any proposition,
P, ¬P is also a proposition; and what it means is,
exactly, P → false. If P is true, then false is true,
and false cannot possibly be true, so P must not be.

Thus, to prove ¬P you prove P → false. Another way
to read P → false is that, if we assume that P is
true, we can derive a proof of false, which cannot
exist, so P must not be true. MEMORIZE THIS REASONING.

Again, to prove ¬P, *assume P and show that in that
context, you can derive a contradiction in the form
of a proof of false. This is the strategy call proof
by contradiction.
-/

How about we prove ¬(0 = 1) in English.

Proof. By negation. Assume 0 = 1 and show
that this leads to a contradiction. That 
is, show 0 = 1 → false.

The rest of the proof is by case analysis on 
the assumed proof of 0 = 1. The only way to
have a proof of equality is by the reflexive
property of =. But the reflexive property
doesn't imply that there's a proof of 0 = 1. 
So there can be no proof of 0 = 1, and the
assumption that 0 = 1 is a contradiction.

We finish the proof by case analysis on the
possible proofs of 0 = 1, of which there are
zero. So in all (zero!) cases, the conclusion
(false) follows. Therefore 0 = 1 → false, which
is to say, ¬(0 = 1) is proved and thus true. 
QED.
-/

example : ¬0 = 1 :=
begin
  show 0 = 1 → false,   -- rewrite goal to a definitionally equal goal
  assume h,
  cases h,                -- there are *zero* ways to build a proof of 0 = 1
                          -- case analysis discharges our "proof obligation"
end
