Operations on relations
-/

/-
We now change our attention to binary relations
more generally: not just from β → β but between
different types, α and β. Not the change in the
type of r as defined here.
-/
variables {α β γ : Type} (r : α → β → Prop)
local infix `≺`:50 := r

/-
In these examples we will treat that the types, 
α and b, as mathematical sets of objects of these
types. 

We will call the set of all α values the "domain
of definition" of the relation r, and we will call
the set of all β values the co-domain of r. Now
the (a, b) pairs of r represent the pairs of values
for which r a b is true. 

Not every value in α needs to be present in the 
set of "a" values that appear as first elements
in the pairs of r. The subset of a values that 
do appear in the first position of some pair in
r is what we will call the domain of the relation. 

The set of b values that appear in the second
positions in all such pairs of r is the set we
will call the *range* of the r. 

Without definitely need to know and understand
the definitions. Be able to write the formal
definitions, which we present next, from your
memory and even more from your understanding 
of what they mean. If you really understand,
then you should be able to derive the formal
definition without having memorized it. Here
are the first four essential terms:

- domain of definition
- domain
- co-domain
- range

It's obviousl that  will always have that 
- domain ⊆ domain of definition
- range ⊆ codomain

With these concepts in hand, we can really start
to  precisely and clearly define powerful ideas
in set theory, and to express and prove theorems
in this setting.
-/

/-
We begin with sets involved in any relation, 
r : α → β. For simplicity here, we will assume
that the domain of definition set in examples
that follow is specified by the type α, and
that the co-domain set is specificed by the
β type.
-/
def domain_of_definition (r : α → β → Prop) : set α := 
  { a : α | true } 

#check @domain_of_definition


def domain (r : α → β → Prop) := { a : α | ∃ b, r a b }
def co_domain (r : α → β → Prop) := { b : β | true }
def range (r : α → β → Prop) := { b : β | ∃ (a : α), r a b  }

-- EXAMPLE
def R : ℕ → string → Prop := λ n m, n = m.length
#check domain_of_definition R
#reduce domain_of_definition R
#check co_domain R
#reduce co_domain R -- what set?
#check domain R
#reduce domain R    -- a set, right?
#check range R
#reduce range R     -- a set, right?


/-
It will often be useful to consider the
subrelation obtained by restricting the
domain of a relation to elements of a given
set. If a relation relates three cats, c1, 
c2, and c3, to their ages, let's say a1, a2
and a3, respectively, then restricting the
domain of r to the set, s = {c1, c3}, would
give the relation associating c1 and c3 with
their corresponding ages, but there would 
be no (c2, a2) pair in the restricted form
of the relation because c2 ∉ s. An analogous
definition gives us *range* restriction as
an operation on relations.
-/

/-
Note that these operations takes relations (and
sets) as arguments and return new relations!
-/
def dom_res (r : α → β → Prop) (s : set α) : α → β → Prop := 
  λ a b, a ∈ s ∧ r a b

def ran_res (r : α → β → Prop) (s : set β) : α → β → Prop := 
begin
  assume a b,
  apply r a b,
end



/-
In a relation in general, an α value can have zero,
one, or more corresponding β values. As a nice example,
consider the binary relation on real numbers defined
by x^2 + y^2 = 1^2. From basic algebra, recall that,
by the pythagorean theorem, this relation comprises
all of the x-y pairs in the unit circle. It's the
set of real number (x,y) pairs for which x^2+y^2=1.

Now where x is zero, as an example, there is not one
but there are two corresponding y values: -1 and 1.
That's fine because a relation is *any* subset of
the set of all α-β pairs. In particular, the "circle"
relation contains both (0,1) and (0,-1). Each pair
satisfies the specification, that x^2+y^2=1. Be sure
you see that this simple algebraic claim is correct.

If we think of "applying" a relation to a value, then,
we have to get back not a single value, in general, but
a set of values that could, in general, be empty, be
a singleton set, or have more than one value. In our
case here where r is the unit circle relation, what
should we expect as the value of (r 0)?

Yes, it's the set { 1, -1 }. We will this result set
the "image" of 0 under r. I guess you can think of r
as being like a bright light shining on 0 from the
left and being blocked from projecting through to the
corresponding β values except for where that 0 is.
What gets illuminated in this case is the set of β 
values, { 1, -1 }.

We can then easily extend this concept to the image
of a set of α values.

Note that the folloowing operations take a relation
and a value and return a set of values.
-/

def image_val (a : α) : set β := -- the second elements of the pairs from the domain restriction
{ b : β | a ≺ b } -- for a is related to b

-- image of a set, s, under r
def image_set (s : set α) : set β :=
{ b : β | ∃ a : α, a ∈ s ∧ r a b}


/- EXERCISE

Define the concepts of the pre-image of a
value of type β or of a set of such values.

/-
Here's another operation that takes a relation
and returns a relation: namely the same as the
original but with all the pair arrows reversed.
-/

-- inverse of r
def inverse : β → α → Prop :=
λ (b : β) (a : α), r a b


/-
Finally we have this beautiful operation that
takes two relations as arguments and glues them
together into a new end to end relation.
-/
-- composition of s with r
def composition (s : β → γ → Prop) :=
  λ a c, (∃ b, s b c ∧ r a b)
