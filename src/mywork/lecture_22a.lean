First, we need to define congruence mod n.
Technically it is defined not only on the
natural numbers but on the integers. 

Here's the English language definition:
Given a natural number, n, greater than 1 
(a "modulus"), two natural numbers, a and 
b, are "congruent modulo n", if n is a 
divisor of their difference: that is, if 
there is some natural number, k such that 
a − b = kn).

Your first task is to define cong_mod,
formally, stating that for any value, 
n, cong_mod n is a binary relation 
on natural numbers, as defined above.
-/

def cong_mod (n a b : ℤ) : Prop :=
  ∃ k, a - b = k * n

/-
Second, formally state the proposition that
for each natural number, n, "cong_mod n" is 
an equivalence relation. You should use the
"equivalence" predicate on binary relations
defined in Lean's library (which is the same
as our definition from the last lecture) in
writing this propopsition.
-/

def cong_mod_n_is_equiv_relation (n : ℤ) : Prop := 
  equivalence (cong_mod n) 

/-
Note that partial evaluation makes 
cong_mod n into a binary relation: in
that it's waiting for two more natural
number arguments, let's say, a and b,
and when applied to such arguments, 
it yields the proposition that the 
two numbers are congruent as defined.

-- First, translate the goal into ordinary notation

example : cong_mod (4:ℤ) (6:ℤ) (14:ℤ) :=

  unfold cong_mod,
  apply exists.intro (-2:ℤ),
  apply rfl,

Now assert and prove this proposition to be
a theorem, i.e., to have a proof.

  -- reflexive

  assume k,

  apply exists.intro (0:ℤ),

  -- symmetric

  unfold symmetric cong_mod,

  cases h with v pf, --just applies the elimination rule
  apply exists.intro (-v),
  have lemma1 : -v * n = -(v * n) := sorry,
  rw lemma1,
  rw <-pf, -- arrow is the direction you use the equality to do the rewritting 
  have lemma2 : y - x = -(x - y) := sorry,
  rw <-lemma2,

  -- transitive
     -- you prove it

  unfold transitive cong_mod,
  assume x y z h1 h2,
  cases h1 with h1v h1pf,
  cases h2 with h2v h2pf,

A version of congruence mod n restricted to the
natural (non-negative whole) numbers.

Previous problem requires access to negative
numbers because it involves a term a-b, which,
in ℤ can be negative. If it's negative in ℤ it
will simply be truncated to 0 in ℕ, losing
critical information.

To show that modular congruency is a equivalence relationship it is sufficent to show 1) it is reflexive 2) it is symmetric and 3) it is transitive.
These three individual proofs can be combined trivially using the introduction rule for and. 
Reflexivity is proved by showing that any x % n is = x % n by way of the reflexivity property of equality. 
Symmetry is proven by an arbitrary use of the symmetric property of equality to show that x%n = y%n implies y%n = x%n.
Transivity is proven by subituting the two assumed truths into the goal until a trivial equality is achieved.
